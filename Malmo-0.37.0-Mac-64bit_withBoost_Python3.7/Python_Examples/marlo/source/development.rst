Build Docs
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -U sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
  git clone https://github.com/crowdAI/marLo
  cd marLo
  make html
  
  # and then you can review the changes locally by doing : 
  python -m http.server 8000 
  # or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` on python2.*
  # and pointing your browser to localhost:8000 (and then navigating to the build directory)
  # All subsequent changes will require you to rebuild the docs by :
  make html 
  
  
.. Note:: 
  Most of the files in the source directory are generated by ``autodoc``. The only files which are manually generated are :
  - index.rst
  - installation.rst
  - usage/\*.rst
  - usage.rst
  - available_envs.rst
  - development.rst
  - contributors.rst
  
  Any changes to the rest of the docs should be done via the docstrings of the associated functions.
